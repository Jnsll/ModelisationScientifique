# Introduction

Scientific Modelling : 
- representation of a physical system
- model to learn about the reprensented system
- using simulations (do not have info about the system, cannot have them or too expensive to have them, etc)
- lots of data manipulated as input or output

With the need to manipulate data, to simulate some system thanks to models, tools have been developped to help modellers and scientists.

Tools have been implemented in several programming languages, but we will focus on using Python. Indeed, the scientific Python community is quite large and weel established. A lot of tools which are well and largly used have been implemented. Thoses tools are either some development tools or some library to carry out the different tasks.


## Slides

### 1

- First slide with question about what is scientific modelling : "modelling" & "modelling in science" 
    - defining the goals of scientific modelling and the related challenges thanks to brainstorming
        - what
            - representation
            - simulation
        - how
            - equations
            - drawings
            - automates
            - graphs
        - why
            - explore / learn about represented system
            - not possible to retrieve information about the system (e.g in geoscience)
        - challenges
            - more and more data (overwhelming size of datasets) (e.g. genomic data)
            - more and more complex (equations, data, etc)
            - heterogenous (weather forecasting data, energy consumption data, images data, sensors data, etc)

### 2 
- slide with key words about modelling in science
- slide with key words about the related challenges

### 3 
- scientists are trying to fulfill thoses goals and issuing those challenges
- to help them, developpers have created tools
- have an overview of what exists and how to use those tools
- choice of using the Python programming language
    - widely used
    - especially in the scientific communauty
    - lots of specific scientific tools build around it
