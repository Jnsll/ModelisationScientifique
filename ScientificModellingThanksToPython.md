# Teaching

## Overview of the module
### Goals

- Scientific modelling using more and more computers
    - running simulations
    - visualisation (graphs, maps)
    - exploring (calibration, sensitivity analysis, etc)
    - processing data (pre-processing, post-processing)

- tools developped in SE for this
    - helping scientists to model
    - scientists usually does not have the expertise in SE.

### Teachers
 - Luc Lesoil (luc.lesoil@irisa.fr) : Data Manipulation
 - Laurent Morin (laurent.morin@inria.fr) : Distributed computing, Parallel computing
 - June Sallou (june.benvegnu-sallou@irisa.fr) : Python

### Organisation

- 1st part : Python and development tools
- 2nd part : data manipulation
- 3rd part : multi-threading, distributed computating

## Introduction

Scientific Modelling : 
- representation of a physical system
- model to learn about the reprensented system
- using simulations (do not have info about the system, cannot have them or too expensive to have them, etc)
- lots of data manipulated as input or output


With the need to manipulate data, to simulate some system thanks to models, tools have been developped to help modellers and scientists.

Tools have been implemented in several programming languages, but we will focus on using Python. Indeed, the scientific Python community is quite large and weel established. A lot of tools which are well and largly used have been implemented. Thoses tools are either some development tools or some library to carry out the different tasks.


# Scientific Development environments

## Anaconda

## Conda

## Pyvenv / pyenv / virtualenv / venv

### venv


### pyenv : managing the versions of Python

As a standard, only one version of Python can be installed on an operating system at a time. However, it can occur that we want to execute a script with a different version of Python than the default one installed locally on our system / computer. Especially, when you are running tests or because a library used in the project needs a specific version of Python to work.


## pip : installation of packages / libraries


# Installation of Python

## pip


# A little bit of history

Different versions of Python. Be aware of the fact that the Python2 and Python3 versions are not compatible, meaning a script written in Python2 won't be runnable in Python3 and vice versa.


>"Being the last of the 2.x series, 2.7 will receive bugfix support until 2020. Support officially stops January 1 2020 [...]"
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/

Thus, all the examples will use Python3 for the course.
