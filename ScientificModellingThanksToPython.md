# Teaching

## Overview of the module
### Goals

- Scientific modelling using more and more computers
    - running simulations
    - visualisation (graphs, maps)
    - exploring (calibration, sensitivity analysis, etc)
    - processing data (pre-processing, post-processing)

- tools developped in SE for this
    - helping scientists to model
    - scientists usually does not have the expertise in SE.

### Teachers
 - Luc Lesoil (luc.lesoil@irisa.fr) : Data Manipulation
 - Laurent Morin (laurent.morin@inria.fr) : Distributed computing, Parallel computing
 - June Sallou (june.benvegnu-sallou@irisa.fr) : Python

### Organisation

- 1st part : Python and development tools
- 2nd part : data manipulation
- 3rd part : multi-threading, distributed computating

## Introduction

Scientific Modelling : 
- representation of a physical system
- model to learn about the reprensented system
- using simulations (do not have info about the system, cannot have them or too expensive to have them, etc)
- lots of data manipulated as input or output


With the need to manipulate data, to simulate some system thanks to models, tools have been developped to help modellers and scientists.

Tools have been implemented in several programming languages, but we will focus on using Python. Indeed, the scientific Python community is quite large and weel established. A lot of tools which are well and largly used have been implemented. Thoses tools are either some development tools or some library to carry out the different tasks.


# Scientific Development environments

## Why using environments ?
- reproductibility
- 

- different version of Python
- separate site-packages


> all programs share the same global installation

## Anaconda

## Conda
- popular in the scientific community
- combination of package manager (like pip) & env manager (like virtualenv + virtualenvwrapper)
- easier to use ? (considered)
- does not support all the packages that pip does (e.g  beautifulsoup)
(can use pip inside conda)

## Pyvenv / pyenv / virtualenv / venv

### venv

### virtualenv / + wrapper

> [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/ "virtualenv project page") is a tool to create isolated Python environments. virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.
https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/



### pyenv : managing the versions of Python

As a standard, only one version of Python can be installed on an operating system at a time. However, it can occur that we want to execute a script with a different version of Python than the default one installed locally on our system / computer. Especially, when you are running tests or because a library used in the project needs a specific version of Python to work.

### pipenv

> Pipenv is a project that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds to the Python world. It harnesses Pipfile, pip, and virtualenv into one single toolchain. It features very pretty terminal colors.
https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#pip

[Docs](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "Documentation of pipenv") | [Source](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv "Source code to pipenv") | [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/ "pipenv Project Page")

relies on two seperate files :
- pipfile
    - similar to requirements.in  -> requirements.txt
    - human readable
- pipfile.lock
    - real requirements.txt

    pipfile + lock pipfile : use to regenerate env

- don't need to manipulate you pipfile > pipenv does it for you
- combination of virtualenv + pip
- recommanded by PyPA (Python Packaging Authority)
- use it ot generate and both create env, install dependencies into env, update pipfile / lock file.
Env  : directory associated to a project.

pipenv install package > install package + update pipfile & lock file

pipenv unstall --dev package >> seperate packages dev / production / etc

pipenv shell : activating the virtual env, spaws a sub-shell inside your shell, run in the virtual env

pipenv run python script.py : run the command using the virtual env but only the command. Back to original prompt /shell

pipenv graph : generate graph of packages installed and their dependencies, shows it 

IDE supporting pipenv : PyCharm, VS Code. NOT Atom


Drawbacks : 
- not recommanded if you are creating a package/library. Only for programs
- locking can be slow
- by default, update all the dependencies evry time a new package is installed 
    - can be changed with --selective-upgrade

Pros:
- installs packages and updates lock file in one command
- intalls packages concurrently
- prevents dependency conflit
- check for security

## pip : installation of packages / libraries
- relaesed in 2011
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip freeze (all that is installed, + the dependencies of what is installed)

lack of synchronisation > e.g. if a new package is installed but the requirements.txt is not updated.

# Installation of Python

## pip


# A little bit of history

Different versions of Python. Be aware of the fact that the Python2 and Python3 versions are not compatible, meaning a script written in Python2 won't be runnable in Python3 and vice versa.


>"Being the last of the 2.x series, 2.7 will receive bugfix support until 2020. Support officially stops January 1 2020 [...]"
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/

Thus, all the examples will use Python3 for the course.


# Installation of Python libraries

## PyPI

> The Python Package Index (PyPI) is a repository of software for the Python programming language.
https://pypi.org/





# Python IDE

## IDLE
- "Integrated Development and Learning Environment"
- comes with the installation of Python

## IPython
