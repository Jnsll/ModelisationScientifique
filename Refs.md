# Introduction

Scientific Modelling : 
- representation of a physical system
- model to learn about the reprensented system
- using simulations (do not have info about the system, cannot have them or too expensive to have them, etc)
- lots of data manipulated as input or output


With the need to manipulate data, to simulate some system thanks to models, tools have been developped to help modellers and scientists.

Tools have been implemented in several programming languages, but we will focus on using Python. Indeed, the scientific Python community is quite large and weel established. A lot of tools which are well and largly used have been implemented. Thoses tools are either some development tools or some library to carry out the different tasks.
