# Teaching

## Overview of the module
### Goals

- Scientific modelling using more and more computers
    - running simulations
    - visualisation (graphs, maps)
    - exploring (calibration, sensitivity analysis, etc)
    - processing data (pre-processing, post-processing)

- tools developped in SE for this
    - helping scientists to model
    - scientists usually does not have the expertise in SE.

### Teachers
 - Luc Lesoil (luc.lesoil@irisa.fr) : Data Manipulation
 - Laurent Morin (laurent.morin@inria.fr) : Distributed computing, Parallel computing
 - June Sallou (june.benvegnu-sallou@irisa.fr) : Python

### Organisation

- 1st part : Python and development tools
- 2nd part : data manipulation
- 3rd part : multi-threading, distributed computating
